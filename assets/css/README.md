## Wireframes.
---
Our Wireframes were created using a [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). We created representations of various screen sizes in order to map out our responsive design. The design of the final site however changed quite significantly throughout the design process. These changes I feel have elevated the final product above what was initially planned in at the Wireframe stage.

## Site Structure.
---
Our site utilised a simple, easy to navigate site-structure, as is illustrated in the below diagram. We felt this best suited the needs of the site, which weren't overly-complicated or information heavy.

## Design Choices.
---
### Typography. 
We used 'Roboto' and 'Exo' fonts across our website to achieve a modern, clean asthetic. We feel this suits the younger demographics attracted to festivals such as PennFest.

### Colour Scheme.
We chose an eclectic mixture of colours, which nontheless gave the site a vibrant, celebratory feel. While we wanted the overall experience to be clean and easily accesible, we felt it important to include ample amounts of colour across the different pages to bring the festival itself to life somewhat. We reused the same colours found within our main logo across much of the site, and would like to further expand this in later iterations if possible.
